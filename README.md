# movie-recommendation-system

Welcome to my **Movie Recommendation System** project! This repository contains the code and files to create a recommendation system using the **k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)** algorithm, specifically using **collaborative filtering**. The system suggests movies based on users' past ratings and preferences.

## Overview

In this project, I created a recommendation system for predicting the movies that users might enjoy based on their historical ratings. The system is based on the **MovieLens dataset**, which contains user ratings for various movies. I used the **k-NN** algorithm with **cosine similarity** for item-based collaborative filtering to make predictions about movies that a user has not yet rated.

### Key Features:
- Predicts ratings for movies that users have not yet rated.
- Recommends the top movies based on a user's past preferences.
- Evaluates the model's performance using **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**.
- Uses **Surprise** library for building and evaluating recommendation models.
